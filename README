 The time has come for YOU to make a game.Hangman game!
 I have started for you here, but there is a lot of functionality missing.
 My challenge for you is to build on this and make the greatest game.Hangman game ever.

 Some suggestions to functionality you can add:
  
- Saving of already guessed letters
- Not allowing the user to guess (and get points for) a letter he / she have previously guessed.
- Give the user feedback on whether or not the guess is correct
- Showing the user where in the word the character is located
     (Example: 
     "You guessed: E
     This is correct!
     _ E _ _ E _ _ _ _ _")
- Make an illustration of the hanged man
- Show the user guesses he made that weren't correct 
     (Exampe: 
     "You guessed: E
     This is correct!
     _ E _ _ E _ _ _ _ _"
     "Wrong guesses: C, K, P)
- Ask the user if he / she wants to play again 
     - Count wins and losses and display this to the user
